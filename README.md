# PokeApi-Integration
Hey Team! Welcome back to my repository! 
Things to think about 
-My Motivation for this project was to create a simple interface where a user could retrieve information about any Pokemon of their choice. 
-This solves the problem of scowering different sites on to gather information - you can find it all here in 1 place. 
With this particular project I leared how to implement JavaScript functionality to my webpages to add the interactivity apsect for example when buttons are clicked. 

-This webpage works by using the input box labled "Pokemon".
Step 1. Enter the name of the desired Pokemon into the text filed that you would like more info on. 
Step 2. Press the "Catch em'" button to activate the search
Step 3. Review the info of the Pokemon that was returned and repeat the process if you would like to catch another! 
Note: The webpage will only return information for valid names of actual Pokemon. If the name is not found you will recieve and error.
Languages Used: HTML, JavScript.

You can run this project on your local machine by downloading the the code file from this repo and opening the HTML page in a browser using the 'live server' extension or another of your choosing. 

Enjoy!
